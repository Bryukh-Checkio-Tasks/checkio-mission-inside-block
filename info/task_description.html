    For city planing it's import to understand borders of various city structures.
    Parks, lakes or living blocks can be represented as closed polygon.
    And we can describe it with cartesian coordinates.
    We need functionality to determine is a point (a building or a tree) lies inside the structure.

<p>
    A city structure is a polygon, which is represented as a sequence of vertex coordinates on a
    plane.
    Vertices are connected sequentially with the last vertex in the list connecting to the first.
    And we have coordinates of the point which we want to check.
    If the point of impact lies on the edge of the polygon then it is inside.
    For this mission, you need to determine whether the point lies inside the polygon.

    For example, on the left image you see a polygon which is described by
    ((2,1),(1,5),(5,7),(7,7),(7,2)) and the point at (2,7). The result is False.<br>
    For the right image the point lies on the edge (it's counted as inside) so the result is True
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong> Two arguments. Polygon coordinates as a tuple of tuples with two integers each.
    A checking point coordinates as a tuple of two integers.</p>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> Whatever the point inside the polygon or not as a boolean.</p>

    <strong>Example:</strong>
<textarea data-code="python">
is_inside(((1,1),(1,3),(3,3),(3,1)), (2,2)) == True
is_inside(((1,1),(1,3),(3,3),(3,1)), (4,2)) == False
</textarea>
</div>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This concept is using for image recognizing. But as we said early it can be useful
    for topographical software and city planning.
